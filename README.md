# Red-Yellow Game

This is a game where you play against the computer.  
Each turn, you have two choices: 'red' or 'yellow'.  
The computer randomly chooses 'red' or 'yellow' each turn as well.  

If you both choose 'red', you gain 2 points.  
If you both choose 'yellow', you gain 1 point.  
If you choose 'red' and the computer chooses 'yellow', you lose 2 points.  
If you choose 'yellow' and the computer chooses 'red', you lose 1 point.  

The aim of the game is to get to 5 points in as few turns as possible!
